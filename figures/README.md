- Differential expression analysis between edited (H1_AAVS1 via Cas9-HDR) and wild-type (H1_WT) samples.
- Highlighted genes meet FDR < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 thresholds.
- Top 10 most significant genes are labeled.

## ðŸ“Š PCA Plot

**File:** `example_PCA_all_samples.pdf`

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of all RNA-seq samples.
